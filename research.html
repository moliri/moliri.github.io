                <h3 id="subsection"> Continual Crowd Support in ARS </h3> <i>Fall 2017-present</i> <br>
                Studying the ability to support the shared regulation of learning in Agile Research Studios by exploring ways to monitor student progress, recognize when students need additional supports, identify resources within the studio community that could support them, and optimize the routing of those support requests to the resources that have the expertise and ability to help.

                <h3 id="subsection"> <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu/projects/dtr_process"> Agile Research Studio Model </a> </h3> <i>Spring 2014-present</i> <br>
                Agile Research Studios (ARS) is a new socio-technical model for creating a research community of practice that socially shares regulation of learning to apprentice undergraduate teams into research at scale. ARS methodologies, social structures, and tools help groups learn better together so more undergraduates can conduct authentic research.

                <h3 id="subsection"> <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu/projects/crowd_cheer"> CrowdCheer </a> </h3> <i>Fall 2014-present</i> <br>
                Studying the ability to leverage ad-hoc crowds for the completion of real-time tasks in the physical world, specifically, crowdsourcing motivation for marathon runners from the crowd of spectators. Studying methods of motivating crowdworker participation by scaffolding requests off of existing crowdworker behavior.

                <h3 id="subsection"> Assessment of Project Based Learning Skills in Iterative Design Learning Environments </h3> <i>Summer 2017</i> <br>
                Studied the ability to assess project based learning skills for novices working in highly ill-structured problem spaces, namely in the iterative design domain. We present a novice an expert model of iterative design practices, an assessment tool to evaluate student problem representations and plans, and an iterative process of developing expert and novice models through critique and iterative assessment. 

                <h3 id="subsection"> Design of Iterative Design Learning Environments </h3> <i>Summer 2017</i> <br>
                Worked with a team of five researchers to design, evaluate, and iterate upon a learning environment design to support the development of iterative design skills in novice designers. The learning environment consisted of instructional design, and tools to scaffold externalizing design problem representations and project plans.

                <h3 id="subsection"> Independent Development Plans </h3> <i>Fall 2017-present</i> <br>
                Studying how to support student awareness and reflection on their own research processes, and what prevents them from being effective.<br>
                <b>Student:</b> Nneoma Oradiegwu 

                <h3 id="subsection"> <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu/projects/dtr">Polaris </a> </h3> <i>Fall 2016-Spring 2017</i> <br>
                To help undergraduates monitor and reflect on their research progress and to make effective use of mentor time, we introduce Polaris, a scaffolding tool that supports novice researchers diagnosing project issues on their own. Polaris guides undergraduate researchers through a reflective exercise using computer-based prompts and templates to create and diagnose issues in design arguments, which detail core hypotheses in design-based research projects. <br>

                <h3 id="subsection"> inShape </h3> <i>Winter 2014</i> <br>
                Studied the ability to improve campus health by encouraging physical activity via coordinated collective experiences. Studied how we might collect valuable data from physical activities molded into physical crowdsourcing tasks.

                <h3 id="subsection"> DIY Concert Scene </h3> <i>Fall 2014</i> <br>
                Studied the location disclosure patterns of garage/basement concert performers to understand patterns of implicit vs. explicit venue disclosureover social media in the context of unwantedattention from law enforcement/concert crashers.

                <h3 id="subsection"> Makeathon </h3> <i>Fall 2014</i> <br>
                Designed and facilitated a design charrette where novice designers learned to first understand the existing contributors to student health problems on the Northwestern Campus, and to then brainstorm and storyboard concrete solutions.

                <h3 id="subsection"> ColorBeads </h3> <i>Spring 2014</i> <br>
                Worked on a team of five to design a tangible learning interface, Color Beads -connectable, colorful beads that can link to each other and change color to produce a gradient from the first bead to the last.The goal of the design is to provide a simple interface that allows children to understand traditionally complex concepts like color blending and color theory via simple visual and tangible experiences.
