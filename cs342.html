                                  <p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not).</p>

                                  <p>How do we know if the characteristics we design in our systems will lead to a desired outcome? How do we thoughtfully instantiate our designs in effective interface and system models?  Why do existing solutions not work? Taking a step back, are our technical solutions actually addressing the underlying problems that humans face? Do we actually understand the problem?</p>

                                  <p>Through this course, we will learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves.  In part, we’ll focus on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills. We’ll practice by working on structured team projects, with mentor critique. And we’ll emphasize learning the effective structures you need to design HCI systems. We’ll also focus on softening our critical lens to achieve a deeper understanding of how to solve human problems. We’ll practice expanding our capacities for skills like humility, empathy, curiosity – mindsets that are necessary for a successful designer. Finally, we’ll focus on effective ways of working – methods like agile sprints, rapid prototyping and user testing. In learning to “do”, we will challenge ourselves to face and embrace our fears, imperfections, and failures that may otherwise hold us back from taking the next step forward. Together, we will practice how to approach difficult problems <i>skillfully.</i></p>

                                <p>This week, you will learn to assess risks in your project.  we will first practice by assessing the risks in your problem statement -- what do we know/not know about the user problem? we will then assess risk in our needfinding process -- what are ways we can conduct more effective interviews? you will then take your learnings and conduct a few more interviews to deepen your needfinding. Then discuss your findings, and <b>revise your problem statement</b> for your user group.</p>
