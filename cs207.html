                                  <p>In this course, we will do an in-depth study of object-oriented programming (OOP) and abstract data structures implementation and application. With this knowledge, you will advance to design and build more sophisticated code, with greater structural complexity.</p>
                                  <p>
                                  <p>We will cover topics like inheritance and polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, exception handling, file operations, stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, and graphs. Additional topics include recursion, searching, and sorting algorithms.</p>

                                <p>This week, we will explore a new data structure -- <b>stacks</b>! Imagine your data is structured as a stack of books. If I wanted to remove data (or a book), where do I need to pull the book from? What if I want to add a book to the stack? Where would it go? We will learn how to implement these methods for a stack, and more.

                                <p>Midterm Part 1 is due this week! Parts 2 and 3 will be due in two weeks. If you haven't already, start to plan out how you will implement and test your project designs.</p>

You can think of data structures as more advanced lego blocks that we can use to structure more complex code. We will learn about abstract data types (ADTs), and review our first data structure -- <b>linked lists</b>.

                                <p>This week, we will learn about how to use abstract classes and interfaces to create templates that help us <b>structure</b> and <b>standardize</b> our code. For example, if we want to design many objects to represent roles of different people in the university (e.g. Student, Faculty, Staff), we might want to design a <b>broader</b> abstract class that defines things that all roles will have (i.e. variables like "email").

                                <p>This week, we will explore exception and file handling. For example, how do we <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> to a text file from our code? Or if we know a bit of our code is risky (like trying to open a file that doesn't exist), how do we <b>catch</b> and handle those risks before it crashes our code?

                                <p>As part of this course, I will challenge you to reflect on your learning process each week through the weekly self-assessments, due every Friday at 11:59p. Your first self-assessment is due at the end of this week.</p>

                                <p>HW 1 is also released this week! You may work with up to one partner on the homeworks. You get about 2 weeks to work on homeworks. Start early, so you can get help with bugs from your Peer Leaders! See the syllabus for more rules on homework submissions. </p>
