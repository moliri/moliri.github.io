                                  <p>In this course, we will do an in-depth study of object-oriented programming (OOP) and abstract data structures implementation and application. With this knowledge, you will advance to design and build more sophisticated code, with greater structural complexity.</p>

                                  <p>We will cover topics like inheritance and polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, exception handling, file operations, stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, and graphs. Additional topics include recursion, searching, and sorting algorithms.</p>

                                <p>This week, we will explore an important programming technique -- <b>recursion</b>! Imagine an array of sorted data -- numbers. Let's say you want to search that array to see if the number 97 exists. In a worst case, the number is in the last spot, and we have to use a for loop to check each spot until we reach the end. What if there were a <b>simpler approach</b> to solving the problem? Could we search sub-regions within the array, and slowly narrow down our search instead of searching every spot?</p>

                                <p>This week, we will explore our next data structure -- <b>lists</b>! You have already seen many examples of lists in practice. This week, we'll consider specific situations, like how do you add data to a <b>sorted list</b>? For example, how do you find the spot where the data should go? We'll also explore more complex lists, like <b>doubly-linked lists</b> that link forwards and backwards. These advanced implementations allow you to access data from either end of a linked list.</p>

                                <p>This week, we will learn about our next major data structure -- <b>queues</b>! Imagine data that represents people standing in a line waiting to pick up pizza. When a new person joins the line, where do they go? When someone leaves the line to walk to the counter, who goes first? We'll practice implementing data structures that support this concept of how queues work. </p>

If I wanted to remove data (or a book), where do I need to pull the book from? What if I want to add a book to the stack? Where would it go? We will learn how to implement these methods for a stack, and more. </p>

We will learn about abstract data types (ADTs), and review our first data structure -- <b>linked lists</b>.

                                <p>This week, we will learn about how to use abstract classes and interfaces to create templates that help us <b>structure</b> and <b>standardize</b> our code. For example, if we want to design many objects to represent roles of different people in the university (e.g. Student, Faculty, Staff), we might want to design a <b>broader</b> abstract class that defines things that all roles will have (i.e. variables like "email").

Or if we know a bit of our code is risky (like trying to open a file that doesn't exist), how do we <b>catch</b> and handle those risks before it crashes our code?

                                <p>Your next Workshop session is this Thursday from 8-9a, via Zoom. Check Slack for the Zoom link! Folks who cannot attend can find recordings linked in the progress map.</p>

                                <p>As part of this course, I will challenge you to reflect on your learning process each week through the weekly self-assessments, due every Friday at 11:59p. Your first self-assessment is due at the end of this week.</p>

                                <p>HW 1 is also released this week! You may work with up to one partner on the homeworks. You get about 2 weeks to work on homeworks. Start early, so you can get help with bugs from your Peer Leaders! See the syllabus for more rules on homework submissions. </p>
